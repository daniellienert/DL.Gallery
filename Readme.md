# Neos Gallery
This package provides a node type to easily render image galleries. 

## Gallery Source
The images to show in a gallery need to be grouped by a tag which than can be selected in the inspector.

## Gallery Presentation
Currently the thumbnails of the gallery are displayed squared using a bootstrap grid. The lightbox [photoswipe](http://photoswipe.com/) is used to open the large version in a lightbox.
